# **Megathread Summary: Suno Tips and Tricks**

This Reddit megathread is a community-driven collection of advice, techniques, and troubleshooting for using the AI music generation service, Suno. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic usage to advanced prompt engineering and integration with other tools.  Key areas discussed include:

*   **Lyric Structure and Punctuation:**
    *   Punctuation significantly influences the AI's interpretation of pacing and emphasis.  Sparse punctuation is more effective than correct punctuation.
    *   Commas create short pauses, ellipses create longer pauses.
    *   Quotation marks can alter voice, accent, or style.
    *   Capitalization emphasizes words or phrases.
    *   Structuring lines (e.g., run-on sentences for faster flow) can influence the musical style.

*   **Vocal Control and Effects:**
    *   Achieving "dual lyrics" (two voices singing different lyrics simultaneously) is challenging. "Layered vocals" in the style prompt is suggested.
    *   Specific vocal styles (e.g., "minimal lyrical singing, sparse humming") can be requested.
    *   Techniques for adding screams and other vocalizations are discussed, including using brackets (e.g., `[(guttural scream)]`) and capitalization.
    * Using foreign language characters to get a non standard accent, by writing the lyrics with foreign characters, remastering and changing the lyrics to the standard character.

*   **Prompt Engineering:**
    *   Using specific musical terms (BPM, pitch, voice style) can improve results.
    *   Referencing musical styles rather than specific artists (e.g., "Zimmer-core" instead of "Hans Zimmer") is recommended.
    *   Using "exclude styles" can help avoid unwanted elements.
    *   Using random strings (from QRNG generators) can introduce variety.

*   **Genre and Style Manipulation:**
    *   Experimenting with unusual genre combinations (e.g., "Hindi Boombap") is encouraged.
    *   Specifying instrumentation (e.g., "instrumental-heavy") can influence the output.
    *   Requests for specific regional styles (like a Mexican "grito") are discussed, with varying success.

*   **Integration with Other Tools:**
    *   **ChatGPT:** Used for generating lyrics, formatting prompts, exploring song styles, and analyzing existing songs. Several custom GPTs are specifically designed for Suno.
    *   **Audio Editing Software (Audacity, Serato Studio, djay Pro):** Used for stem separation (isolating vocals and instrumentals), and general audio post processing.
    *   **Stem Separation Tools (Open Vino Music Separation Plugin, Ultimate Vocal Remover):** Mentioned as alternatives for isolating vocals and instruments.
    *   **Cyanite.ai, Sonoteller.ai, Music.ai:** Used for analyzing the genre, style, and other metadata of existing songs to inform Suno prompts.
    *	**Neural Frames:** For turning song into music videos.

*   **Troubleshooting and Workarounds:**
    *   Download issues are sometimes resolved by disabling VPNs.
    *   Voice changes during song extensions are acknowledged as a limitation of the underlying machine learning models.
    *   The "metallic hiss" or lack of dynamics in some Suno outputs is discussed.
    *   Techniques for reducing the prominence of certain instruments (e.g., synth solos) are explored.
    *   Workarounds for monetizing songs created with a free account are discussed (e.g., extending and modifying the song).

*   **General Tips and Observations:**
    *   Suno's interpretation of lyrics and prompts can be unpredictable.
    *   The AI may sometimes insert unexpected elements (e.g., radio breaks, profanity).
    *   Credits may expire, and users report losing credits.
    *   The community debates the balance between sharing songs and providing explanations of how they were created.
    *   Using Suno in conjunction with ChatGPT for lyric and structure generation often provides better, more coherent results.
    *   Experimentation and iterative refinement are key to achieving desired outcomes.

* **Credit Loss:**
    * Reports of users losing credits.

* **Advanced editing**

# THE SECRET TO CREATING GOOD SUNO MUSIC

**Summary:**

This post and its comments focus on improving the quality of music generated by Suno AI by emphasizing lyrical quality, structure, and detailed prompting.  The main points are:

*   **Lyric Quality is Key:** The core message is that good lyrics, stories, hooks, and "lyrical conversations" are essential.  Don't rely solely on Suno's generic lyric generation.

*   **Structure and Directional Prompts:** Use a clear song structure (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro) and include specific commands within the lyrics section using double brackets `[[ ]]` to guide the AI.  Examples include `[[Harmonize female vocals]]`, `[[chop, layer, echo, reverb, attack]]`, and `[[Vocal ad-libs]]`. These prompts are placed *within* the lyric section, at the beginning of relevant parts.

*   **Genre-Specific Advice (for Electronic Music):** For genres like house, EDM, future bass, and D&B, the author suggests that only a few lines of lyrics are needed.  Focus on a catchy hook and "call and response" lines.

*   **Persona and Character:** Give the AI "personas" accents and character traits in the style description (e.g., "soulful uplifting sultry female vocal with husky British voice"). This can help with later NFT/tokenization efforts (though this is not explained further).

*   **Duets and Vocal Interaction:**  Create duets by specifying which voice should sing which line (e.g., `[Male]`, `[Female]`, `[Together]`).  "Call and response" prompts are also recommended. There are various ways users have found to make duets using the prompt and lyric area, such as, `[[MALE VOICE] (FEMALE VOICE)]]` and prompting `Lyrics here(lyrics here)`.

*   **Using 3rd Party AI for Assistance:**  Use other AI tools (implied: ChatGPT or similar) to help craft song structure.  Don't accept the AI's first suggestion; refine it by asking for more soulful, uplifting, or gritty results.  Then, *humanize* the AI-generated lyrics by changing words and adding colloquialisms.  This is presented as a way to *learn* lyric writing, not as a replacement for it.

*   **Vocal Techniques:** Learn about singing styles, rapping techniques, and the language of lyricism.  Specific vocal terms like "rubato," "melismatic," and Italian musical terms are mentioned.

*   **Ending the Song:**  Use prompts like `[[Beats fade out echo clean]]` to prevent abrupt endings.

*   **"HD Quality studio Production"**:  Try adding this to the style box.

*   **Double Brackets [[ ]]**: The author consistently uses double brackets for in-lyric commands, claiming that single brackets `[]` or parentheses `()` can be misinterpreted by Suno as lyrics.

*   **Experimentation:**  The overall tone encourages experimentation and pushing the AI beyond its default tendencies.  The results are not always perfect, and multiple attempts may be needed.

* **BPM Control**: You can specify a tempo by using `[TEMPO:80BPM]`.

* **Drum Control** - How to start a song with drums and slowly add more musical elements throughout the progression of the song.

# A guide for creating better and more consistent songs

**Summary:**

This post provides advice from an experienced Suno user who has released an album created using the AI.  The focus is on achieving consistency and maximizing the strengths of different Suno versions.

*   **Intro and First Verse are Crucial:**  These sections set the tone for the entire song.
*   **Qualifying Tags for Vocals:** Use detailed tags like `[Smooth Sensual Female Vocal]` both before each verse and in the overall style tags section to ensure consistent vocal style throughout the song.
*   **Abuse Tags for Layers and Control:** Use tags within the lyrics section to specify musical elements, like `[Bluesy Guitar Arpeggio]` or `[Smooth Bass Line]`.  This gives more fine-grained control over the instrumentation.
*   **Onomatopoeia for Complex Effects:** Use sounds written out (e.g., "...eeeeeennnnnn...") within tags to describe and influence sustained notes or other effects.  Example: `[Sitar, single sustained note, shimmering with vibrato] (e.g., “…eeeeeennnnnn…”)`.
*   **Leverage v3.5 and v4:**
    *   v3.5 is generally better for song structure, instrumentals, and overall stability.
    *   v4 typically produces better vocals.
    *   The recommended workflow is to generate the full song in v3.5 and then *remaster* it in v4 to get the improved vocals.
*   **Always Extend from the Full Song:** When using the "Extend" feature, always start from the complete generated song.  Extending from a partial section limits Suno's understanding of the overall context.
* **"Hallucinated" songs method**:
    * Create a song with no lyrics, let it generate a melody.
    * Find a performance you like.
    * Use "replace" on the first section with your lyrics and extend from there.

**External URLs (Outside of Reddit):**

# CAPTCHAs 10 times a day while using Suno?", along with any external URLs (there are none in this case):

**Summary:**

The original poster (OP) complains about frequently encountering CAPTCHAs (around every 15 songs generated) while using Suno, finding it highly disruptive and annoying. They are posting in the hope that Suno developers will see and address this issue, as it's making them consider canceling their subscription.

The comments reveal a wide range of experiences:

*   **Many users report *never* encountering CAPTCHAs:**  A significant number of commenters state they've used Suno extensively (hundreds or even thousands of songs) without ever seeing a CAPTCHA. This suggests the issue is not universal.

*   **Possible Triggers:**
    *   **Rapid Generation:** The OP admits to generating songs quickly to use up expiring credits.  This rapid-fire use is identified as a likely trigger, similar to rate-limiting on other AI platforms.  Suno's "10 running jobs at once" feature is acknowledged as a *possibility*, not a recommended practice.
    *   **VPN Use:** Several users suggest that using a VPN can cause CAPTCHA prompts.  Turning off the VPN, or changing its location, is offered as a potential solution.
    *   **Simultaneous Logins:**  One user reports experiencing CAPTCHAs only when logged into both the Suno app and website simultaneously.
    *  **Email setup:** A commentor suggests that the users email might be affecting it, advising to not use email forwarding.
    *  **Browser:** It's suggested that using Firefox might be causing more CAPTCHAs

*   **Bot Prevention:**  It's generally understood that CAPTCHAs are implemented to prevent bot activity and protect server resources.  While annoying, they are seen as a lesser evil compared to being completely blocked by bot traffic.

* **Staying logged in**: Commentors suggest that by staying logged in using the Google sign-in method, they have never encountered a CAPTCHA

In essence, the thread highlights a discrepancy in user experience.  While the OP is significantly impacted by CAPTCHAs, many others are not.  The consensus leans towards rapid generation and VPN usage as the most likely causes, with the underlying purpose being bot prevention. There is no suggestion that the CAPTCHAs are *intended* for regular users under normal usage patterns.

**External URLs:** There are no external URLs in this post or the comments.

# THE SECRET TO CREATING GOOD SUNO MUSIC

**Summary:**

This post and its extensive comments provide a guide to improving the quality of music generated by Suno, focusing on lyric quality, prompt engineering, and song structure. The core advice is to actively craft the lyrics and use detailed prompts rather than relying on Suno's default settings.

**Main Points:**

*   **Lyrics are Key:** The most important aspect is writing "awesome lyrics, stories, hooks, and lyrical conversations." This includes creating a theme or backstory.
*   **Structure and [[Prompts]]:** Use song structure (intro, verse, chorus, etc.) and insert commands within the lyrics section using *double* brackets `[[ ]]`. Examples:
    *   `[[Command/prompt]]` for general directions.
    *   `[[chop, layer, echo, reverb, attack]]` for drops and builds.
    *   `[[Harmonize female vocals]]` at the start of a chorus.
    *   `[[call and response]]` for duets.
    *   `[[vocal ad-libs]]` for added depth.
    *   `[[Beats fade out echo clean]]` for a clean ending.
*   **Genre-Specific Advice (EDM):** For electronic genres like house, EDM, D&B, and future bass, only a few lines of lyrics are needed. Focus on a catchy hook.
*   **AI Personas:** Give the AI singers distinct characteristics (e.g., "soulful uplifting sultry female vocal with husky British voice").
*   **Duets:**  Create duets by specifying which voice sings which line (e.g., `[Male]`, `[Female]`).  "Call and response" prompts are suggested.
*   **Using 3rd Party AI:**  Use other AI tools (like ChatGPT) to help with song structure.  Refine the AI's initial suggestions to be more soulful, gritty, etc. Then, *humanize* the AI-generated lyrics by changing words, adding slang, etc.  This is a learning process, not just copy-pasting.
*   **Learn about Music:**  Understand singing styles, rapping techniques, and lyricism.
*   **"HD Quality studio Production":** Try adding this to the "Style of Music" box.
*   **Double Brackets:** The author insists on using `[[ ]]` instead of `[]` or `()`, claiming the latter two can be misinterpreted as lyrics.
*  **BPM Control**: You can specify a tempo by using `[TEMPO:80BPM]`.
* **Drum control**

# Tips and Tricks

Here's a compilation of the most useful Suno tips and tricks, combining the advice from all three provided Reddit posts and their comment sections. I've organized them by category for clarity.  I'm focusing on actionable advice and excluding things like personal anecdotes or general discussions unless they contain specific, helpful techniques.

**I. Core Songwriting and Lyric Crafting**

*   **Write Good Lyrics:** This is consistently emphasized. Focus on strong hooks, stories, and "lyrical conversations." Don't rely on Suno's default lyric generation for quality.  Write them yourself, or if using AI assistance, heavily edit and personalize the results.
*   **Song Structure:** Use a clear, defined structure (Intro, Verse, Pre-Chorus, Chorus, Bridge, Outro, etc.). Label these sections *within* the lyrics input using brackets.
*   **Use ChatGPT for Assistance (with heavy editing):** Use ChatGPT (or similar LLMs) to help you:
    *   Brainstorm song structures.
    *   Refine your *own* lyrics (improve word choice, organization, metaphors).
    *   Analyze existing songs you like for structure and style.
    *   Generate "metatags" or descriptions of how each part of the song should be performed (then heavily adapt these for Suno).
    *   *Do not* simply copy and paste AI-generated lyrics without significant editing.  Humanize them with slang, colloquialisms, and your personal style.
* **Metatags in Lyrics**
	*	Place metatags before each verse, chorus, intro, outro.
	*	Use metatags to indicate specific musical actions or moods in specific parts.

**II. Prompt Engineering and Tagging**

*   **Brackets:** There's disagreement, but the most common advice is:
    *   Use `[]` for *most* in-lyric instructions and musical directions.
    *   Use `()` for backing vocals or responses in a call-and-response.
    *   Some users prefer `[[]]` to prevent Suno from interpreting commands as lyrics. Experiment to see what works best.
*   **Lyric Section Commands:** You can put musical instructions and effects *within* the lyrics section, enclosed in brackets. This gives you more fine-grained control.  Examples:
    *   `[Chorus, Full Orchestra, Choir]`
    *   `[Dynamic: ff]` (ff = very loud, pp = very soft, see section on dynamics below)
    *   `[Vocal Style: Male Choir, Deep and Powerful]`
    *   `[Instructions: Build intensity, layered harmonies]`
    *   `[Effect: Deep Cathedral Reverb]`
    *   `[chop, layer, echo, reverb, attack]` (for drops and builds)
    *   `[Scream]` or `[(guttural scream), My veins!]` – Brackets and capitalization.
    *	  `[laugh in beat "Ha haaaa ha hahaa ha haa"]`
    *   `[Instrumental Break]`
    *   `[Guitar Solo]`
    *	 `[Sitar, single sustained note, shimmering with vibrato] (e.g., “…eeeeeennnnnn…”)`.
*   **"Style of Music" Field:**  Be specific and structured.  Order matters:
    1.  Main Genre/Style (e.g., "Epic Orchestral," "Indie Rock," "Trap")
    2.  Primary Instrumentation (e.g., "deep war drums, male choir," "acoustic guitar, synth bass")
    3.  Atmosphere/Emotions (e.g., "heroic, solemn," "melancholic, ethereal")
    4.  BPM/Rhythm (e.g., "tempo 78 BPM, march-like" or `[TEMPO:80BPM]`)
    5.  Vocal Elements (e.g., "solo contralto female voice," "whispered vocals")
* **Specify tempo**: Use a tag like `[TEMPO:120BPM]` in your prompt.
*   **Vocal Style Tags:**  Use detailed descriptions for vocals, both in the "Style of Music" field *and* before each verse/chorus in the lyrics.  Examples:
    *   `[Smooth Sensual Female Vocal]`
    *   `[Male Vocal]`, `[Female Vocal]`
    *  `[MALE VOICE] [FEMALE VOICE]`
    *   `[Duet with male and female voices blending]`
    *   "soulful uplifting sultry female vocal with husky British voice"
    *  `[[MALE VOICE] (FEMALE VOICE)]]`
    *	  `Lyrics here(lyrics here)`
    *  "minimal lyrical singing, sparse humming"
*   **Exclude Styles:** Use the "Exclude Styles" feature to prevent unwanted instruments or styles.
*   **Avoid Artist Names:** Instead of directly naming artists, use terms like "Zimmer-core" or "Eminem-inspired."
* **Experiment with Punctuation**: Use punctuation sparingly to add the desired pause to vocals.
	*   Commas create short pauses, ellipses create longer pauses.
*   **Referencing Musical Styles:** Use terms like, "Zimmer-core" or "Eminem-inspired".
*   **Using Numbers:** Use numbers instead of writing the numbers.
* **Dual Lyrics:**
     * Add "Layered Vocals"
* **Non-Standard Accents**
     * Write the lyrics in a way that you phonetically want it to sound, using any language that will achieve that sound.
     *  Remaster the song
     *  Edit the lyrics to the original intended words.
* **Specify BPM**
    * Specify the BPM in the prompt or by using [Tempo: 80BPM]
* **Punctuation:**
     * Use punctuation sparingly
     * Comma = Short Pause
     * Elipses = Longer Pause
     * Quotations = Changes tone
* **Specific musical terms**
    * Add terms such as, BPM, pitch and voice styles to the prompt.
*   **"Hallucinated" Songs (Performance-First Workflow):**
    1.  Create a song *without* providing lyrics (or with nonsense lyrics).  Let Suno generate both the music *and* a vocal melody.
    2.  If you like the generated performance, use the "Replace Section" feature to add your *own* lyrics, fitting them to the existing melody. This prioritizes musical performance over pre-written lyrics.
*   **QRNG for Variety:** Use a quantum random number generator (like `https://qrng.anu.edu.au/random-block-alpha/`) and add a random string to the end of your prompt to introduce more variation.
*   **"HD Quality studio Production":**  Try adding this to the "Style of Music" box.
* **Mastering Tags**
    * Add tags such as [professional mastering], [Dolby Atmos mix], [high-fidelity], [high-definition audio], [wide stereo] to the lyrics box at the beginning of each song.

**III. Song Structure and Flow**

*   **Standard Sections:** Use tags like `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]`.
*   **Ending the Song:**  *Always* include `[Outro: Extended]` and `[End: Fade Out]` (or similar) to prevent abrupt endings.  This is crucial.
*   **False Outro:** Create a "false outro" by ending a section prematurely and then extending it, creating a climax.
* **Repeating Sections:**
     * If your song is repeating sections, try deleting [Verse] tags.

**IV. Vocal Techniques and Effects**

*   **Duets:**
    *   Specify "Duet" in the style.
    *   Use `[Male]` and `[Female]` tags before each line or section to indicate who should sing.
    *   Use `[Chorus - Together]` for both voices.
    *   Use "call and response" prompts.
*   **Ad-libs:** Use `( )` or `[[vocal ad-libs]]`.
*   **Runs and Melisma:** Use "melismatic" or spell out runs phonetically.
*   **Vocal Expressiveness:** Use terms like:
    *   "rubato" (flexible tempo)
    *   "heavy breathing," "whispered breath"
    *   "fry scream," "throat singing" (for specific styles)
    *   "vibrato"
* **Humming/Minimal Vocals:**
	*	 In style: "minimal lyrical singing, sparse humming"
	*	 In lyrics: "[intro: no singing]", "[verse: sparse hums](hum, hum, hummmmmmm)" etc.
*   **Dynamics:** Use Italian terms (or their abbreviations) within brackets:
    *   `pp` (pianissimo - very soft)
    *   `p` (piano - soft)
    *  `mp` (mezzo-piano)
    *   `mf` (mezzo forte - moderately loud)
    *   `f` (forte - loud)
    *   `ff` (fortissimo - very loud)
    *  `fff` (fortissimo)
    *   `ffff` (fortississimo - very loud)
    *   `crescendo` (gradually getting louder) - can be written as `>>>`
    *   `decrescendo` or `diminuendo` (gradually getting softer) - can be written as `<<<`
    *   `[Dynamic: pp to ff]` (gradual increase from very soft to very loud)
    *   "sforzando" (sudden, strong accent)
    *   "morendo" (fading away into silence)
*   **Tempo Modifiers:** `[Accelerando]` (speeding up), `[Ritardando]` (slowing down).
*   **Stereo Placement:** `[Stereo Placement: Whispered Vocals Hard Left, Strings Wide Stereo]`
*   **Effects:**
    *   `[Effect: Reverb] (Deep Cathedral, Plate, Gated)`
    *   `[Effect: Granular Synthesis]` (for glitchy effects)
    *   `[Effect: Stereo Panning]`
    *   `[Effect: Exponential Decay Reverb]`
* **Sound Effects**
     * Use brackets [] and put the desired sound effect in the lyrics section

**V.  Working with Other Tools**

*   **ChatGPT (and other LLMs):**  Essential for many advanced techniques.  Use it for:
    *   Lyric generation and refinement.
    *   Prompt formatting.
    *   Exploring song styles and structures.
    *   Analyzing existing songs.
*   **DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations):**  Recommended for post-processing (Audacity is a free option, FL Studio, Reaper, and others are mentioned).  Use them for:
    *   Stem separation (isolating vocals and instruments).  (Ultimate Vocal Remover, Open Vino Music Separation Plugin, Serato Studio, and djay Pro are also mentioned).
    *   EQ adjustments (see next section).
    *   Adding fade-outs.
    *   Mixing and mastering.
*   **Cyanite.ai, Sonoteller.ai, Music.ai:** Use these to analyze existing songs and get metadata to inform your Suno prompts.
*   **NeuralFrames:** Use this for creating music videos.
*   **Converting to Mono:** Before doing extensive editing, it's often recommended to convert the Suno output to mono (using a tool like `https://onlineaudioconverter.com/`) to fix panning issues, then re-introduce stereo width later.

**VI.  Troubleshooting and Fixing Audio Issues (Post-Processing)**

These tips generally require using a DAW or audio editor.

*   **Buried/Overpowered Vocals:**
    *   Reduce low-mid frequencies (200-500Hz) in the instruments.
    *   Boost upper-mid frequencies (2kHz-5kHz) in the vocals.
    *   Apply gentle stereo widening to the vocals.
*   **Hard-Panned Instruments:**
    *   Convert to mono, then re-introduce stereo width.
    *   Manually adjust panning.
*   **Harsh Highs:**
    *   Reduce high frequencies (8kHz-12kHz).
    *   Apply de-essing to smooth out sibilance ("s" and "t" sounds).
*   **Muffled/Muddy Sound:**
    *   Cut low-mid frequencies (200-400Hz).
    *   Boost upper-mid frequencies (2kHz-5kHz).
*   **Random Distorted Sounds (AI Artifacts):**
    *   Try regenerating the song.
    *   Cut harsh frequencies (3kHz-5kHz).
    *   Use noise reduction tools.
*   **Bass Issues:**
    *   If weak: Boost low frequencies (60-100Hz).
    *   If overpowering: Reduce sub-bass (below 50Hz).
* **"Shimmering"**
    * Cut out the 12k range, in the stem where the shimmering sound is.
    * Apply De-Esser
*   **Flat/Lifeless Mix:**
    *   Reduce compression.
    *   Slightly boost upper-mid frequencies (2kHz-5kHz).
    *   Use transient enhancement.
*   **Sudden Volume Dropouts:**
    *   Split the track into stems and fix the missing parts.
    *   Adjust EQ.
    *   If severe, regenerate.
*   **Abrupt Fade-Outs:**
    *   Manually add a fade-out in your editor.
*   **Download Issues:**
     * Disable VPN
*    **Get Whole Song:**
	*	  Find the song you want to use commercially that was made using a free account
	*	  Click extend
	* 	Change the extend time, removing the last two seconds
	*    Regenerate the last two seconds
	*   Click get whole song
* **Getting Back Lost Lyrics**
	*  Extend song from a starting point prior to the wrong words
	*  Add the correct lyrics in the extension section

**VII. General Workflow and Best Practices**

*   **v3.5 vs. v4:** Generate the full song in v3.5 (better structure, instrumentals) and then *remaster* it in v4 (better vocals).
*   **Always Extend from the Full Song:**  When using the "Extend" feature, start from the complete song, not a partial section.
*   **Download as WAV:**  Always download in WAV format for the highest quality.
*   **Iterative Process:**  Experiment, listen critically, and be prepared to regenerate and refine your songs multiple times.
*	**Test on Multiple Devices:** Check how your song sounds on different playback systems.

This comprehensive list covers the vast majority of actionable tips and tricks found within these three Reddit threads.  It provides a detailed roadmap for users who want to significantly improve their Suno creations, from initial prompt crafting to final audio polishing. Remember to experiment, have fun and that this is a process of continous learning.
