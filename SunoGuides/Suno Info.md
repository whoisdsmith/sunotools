# **Report On Suno Website HTML Snippets (Developer Settings)**

**Source:** HTML snippets copied from Suno website developer settings.

**Purpose of Analysis:** To identify HTML elements containing playlist information and song information, and to understand the structure and potential functionality implied by these snippets.

**Findings:**

The analysis is divided into two main sections: Playlist Information and Song Information, corresponding to the two HTML snippets provided.

**Section 1: Playlist Information (Snippet 1)**

This snippet appears to represent the header section of a playlist page or component.

- **Playlist Container:**
  - The entire snippet is enclosed within a `<div>` with classes `css-i8pubi` and `data-theme="dark"`. This suggests a container element for the playlist information, styled with CSS and potentially part of a "dark theme" UI.

- **Playlist Cover Art:**
  - Element: `<img>`
  - Attributes:
    - `alt="Playlist cover art"`: Clearly identifies this image as the playlist's cover art.
    - `data-theme="dark"`: Indicates theme-specific styling.
    - `loading="lazy"`: Improves performance by lazy-loading the image.

  - Element: `<div>` with class `css-1kcq9v9`
  - Contains: "Extend" and "Public" buttons, seemingly duplicated from the right side actions, but positioned differently in the layout.

**Overall Observations and Conclusions:**

- **Semantic HTML:** The snippets use semantic HTML elements (`<h1>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, `<button>`) with appropriate `alt` attributes and `aria-label` for accessibility, indicating good web development practices.
- **CSS Styling:** Extensive use of CSS classes (`css-`, `chakra-`) suggests a component-based UI framework (likely Chakra UI or similar) is being used for styling and layout.
- **Data Attributes:** `data-theme`, `data-clip-id`, `data-testid`, `data-src` attributes are used to store data related to theme, song ID, testing, and image sources.
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links are prevalent, indicating a highly interactive user interface for playlist and song management.
- **Dynamic Content:** The use of `data-src` and image URLs from `cdn2.suno.ai` and `cdn1.suno.ai` points to dynamic loading of content from a content delivery network.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** The interactive elements (buttons, toggles, menus) strongly imply JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, update UI state, and likely manage song playback and other functionalities.
- **No Direct Song Links:** As previously noted, there are no direct HTML tags containing links to the actual song audio files (.mp3, .wav, etc.) in these snippets. Song playback is likely managed dynamically through JavaScript and backend APIs.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The structure and class naming suggest a component-based frontend architecture where UI elements are modular and reusable.
- **Focus on Metadata and UI:** The snippets primarily focus on displaying metadata about playlists and songs and providing UI elements for user interaction. The actual audio streaming and backend logic are abstracted away from these HTML snippets.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**

- **Inspect JavaScript Code:** Examine the JavaScript code associated with these elements (especially event listeners on buttons) to understand how user interactions are handled and how song playback is initiated.
- **Monitor Network Requests:** Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to observe network requests made when interacting with these elements. This can reveal API calls and data exchanged with the backend, potentially including song streaming URLs or playback instructions.
- **Explore Full Page Source:** Analyze the complete HTML source of a playlist page on the Suno website for a broader context and to identify any `<audio>` or `<video>` elements that might be used for playback (though they are likely dynamically created by JavaScript).

| **Artist Profile Link** | `<a>` (nested)                                   | `href` attribute                                                                                                               |
| **Artist Avatar Image URL** | `<img>` (nested)                                  | `data-src`, `src` attributes                                                                                                 |
| **Cover Image URL**       | `<img>`                                         | `data-src`, `src` attributes                                                                                                 |
| **Song Tags/Genres**    | Multiple `<a>` tags within a `<div>`            | Text content (tag name), `href` attribute for style page link, `title` attribute for tooltip.                               |
| **Song Creation Date/Time** | `<span>`                                        | Text content, `title` attribute for full date/time tooltip                                                                     |
| **Song Version**        | `<span>`                                        | Text content (e.g., "v4")                                                                                                     |
| **Audio Links**         | `<audio id="active-audio-play">`, `<audio id="silent-audio">` |  `<audio id="silent-audio"` has `src="https://cdn1.suno.ai/sil-1s.mp3"`. **No direct links to song files found for actual playback.** |

**Key Takeaway regarding Audio Links:**

As in the previous snippets, **there are still no direct HTML tags in this more detailed snippet that provide links to the actual song files (like `.mp3`, `.wav`) for playback.** The `<audio>` tags are present for the player UI, but the `src` for the main player (`active-audio-play`) is empty.  This reinforces the idea that the song URLs are handled dynamically by JavaScript, likely fetched from an API when playback is initiated, and not directly embedded in the HTML source.

- **HTML Element(s):** `<a>` tags within a download menu (as deduced in previous reports).
- **Key Attributes:**
  - `href`: Attribute of the `<a>` tag. This is **hypothesized** to contain the download URL when the download menu is active and download options are presented.
- **Example Content/Value:** Likely dynamic URLs that would be generated on demand and might look something like:
  - `https://suno.com/download/[song_id].mp3`
  - `https://suno.com/download/[song_id].m4a`
  - `https://suno.com/download/[song_id].wav` (for Pro/Premier plans)
  - **Note:** These are *example* URLs and might not be the exact format used by Suno.
- **Notes/Observations:**
  - **Crucially, direct audio download URLs are *not* expected to be found directly embedded in the HTML source in page load.** They are dynamically generated and likely appear *only* when the download menu is triggered and the user is authorized to download.
  - The `<a>` tags for download options ("Download Audio (mp3)", "Download Video (m4a)", "Download Audio (wav)") within the triple-dot menu are the hypothesized HTML elements containing these dynamic download URLs in their `href` attributes.

### Answer to User Query: Extracting and Downloading Songs from a Suno.com User's Song Library

Yes, the provided scripts and tools contain functionality to extract all songs from a Suno.com user's song library, with specific capabilities tailored to different access methods (playlists and artist pages). Below, I'll detail how these tools achieve this, focusing primarily on the two most relevant projects: the **Suno Music Downloader** (a Tauri app under `Sunodownloader/`) and the **Sunodl** Python scripts. These tools address the query by extracting song data from playlists and artist pages, respectively, and downloading the associated files.

---

#### **1. Suno Music Downloader (Tauri App)**

The **Suno Music Downloader**, located in the `Sunodownloader/` directory, is a desktop application built with Tauri and React that excels at downloading entire playlists from Suno.com. Here's how it works:

- **Getting Links from a Playlist:**
  - **User Input:** The process begins in `src/App.tsx` with the `getPlaylist` function. Users paste a playlist URL (e.g., `https://suno.com/playlist/8ebe794f-d640-46b6-bde8-121622e1a4c2`) into a text input field and click "Get playlist songs."
  - **Playlist ID Extraction:** The `Suno.getSongsFromPlayList` method in `src/services/Suno.ts` extracts the playlist ID from the URL using a regex pattern: `/suno\.com\/playlist\/(.*)/`. For the example URL, it retrieves `8ebe794f-d640-46b6-bde8-121622e1a4c2`.
  - **API Fetching:** It then fetches playlist data from Suno's API endpoint: `https://studio-api.prod.suno.com/api/playlist/{playlistId}/?page={currentPage}`. The method paginates through all pages (incrementing `currentPage`) until no more songs are returned (`data.playlist_clips.length == 0`), collecting metadata for each song clip.
  - **Song Data:** Each clip's data (e.g., `id`, `title`, `audio_url`, `image_url`, etc.) is stored in an `IPlaylistClip` array, alongside playlist metadata (`name`, `image`) in an `IPlaylist` object.

- **Downloading Songs:**
  - **Initiation:** After fetching the playlist data, clicking "Download songs" triggers the `downloadPlaylist` function in `src/App.tsx`.
  - **Directory Setup:** It creates an output directory named after the playlist (e.g., `{saveFolder}/{playlistName}`) and a temporary folder (`tmp`) using `ensureDir` from `RustFunctions.ts`.
  - **Parallel Downloads:** Using the `p-limit` library (set to 5 concurrent downloads), it processes each song:
    - **Audio Download:** Fetches the song's `audio_url` (e.g., `https://cdn1.suno.ai/{songId}.mp3`) and writes it to `{outputDir}/{songNo} - {songTitle}.mp3` using `writeFile`.
    - **Cover Art:** Optionally fetches the `image_url`, saves it temporarily (e.g., `tmp/{songId}.jpg`), and embeds it into the MP3 using `addImageToMp3` from `RustFunctions.ts`.
  - **Cleanup:** After all downloads complete, the temporary folder is deleted with `deletePath`.
  - **Progress Tracking:** The UI updates with download progress (via `setDownloadPercentage`) and status icons (via `updateClipStatus`).

- **Relevance to Song Library:** While optimized for playlists, this tool can extract a user's entire song library **if** the user creates a playlist containing all their songs (e.g., a "My Songs" playlist). Without such a playlist, it doesn't directly access the full library.

---

#### **2. Sunodl (Python Scripts)**

The **Sunodl** project, located in the `Sunodl/` directory, offers a more versatile solution, particularly for extracting songs directly from a user's artist page (e.g., `https://suno.com/@username`), which typically lists all songs created by that user. Here's how it accomplishes this:

- **Getting Links from an Artist Page:**
  - **User Input:** In `main.py`, the "Download Artist Collection" option (choice `7`) prompts the user to enter an artist page URL.
  - **Processing URLs:** The `process_urls` function in `suno/processing.py` detects the `@` symbol in the URL and delegates to `fetch_artist_songs` in `utils/artist_song_utils.py`.
  - **Song URL Extraction:** Using Pyppeteer, `fetch_artist_songs` loads the artist page, executes JavaScript to find all `<a>` tags with `href` attributes starting with `/song/`, and constructs full URLs (e.g., `https://suno.com/song/{songId}`). This captures all songs listed on the page, handling pagination implicitly if Suno loads all songs dynamically.
  - **Song Data Fetching:** For each song URL, `fetch_song_data` in `suno/fetch.py` retrieves detailed metadata (title, artist, audio URL, upload date, album art URL) by scraping the page.

- **Downloading Songs:**
  - **Execution:** Back in `process_urls`, each song's data is passed to `download_song` in `utils/file_utils.py`.
  - **File Saving:** It downloads the MP3 from the `audio_url` and the cover art from the `album_art_url`, saving them to `./downloads/{artist}/{title}.mp3` and `./downloads/{artist}/{title}.jpeg`, respectively.
  - **Metadata Embedding:** Using Mutagen, it embeds metadata (title, artist, upload date) and the cover art into the MP3 file.
  - **Logging:** Success or failure is logged in `song_data.txt` via `log_song_data`.

- **Relevance to Song Library:** This approach directly extracts all songs from a user's artist page, making it the most straightforward method for accessing a full song library without requiring a playlist. However, it assumes the artist page lists all songs, which depends on Suno's interface (e.g., no hidden pagination limits).

---

#### **Comparison And Applicability**

- **Suno Music Downloader:**
  - **Strength:** User-friendly GUI, efficient for playlists, embeds cover art into MP3s.
  - **Limitation:** Requires a playlist URL; doesn't natively handle artist pages or the full library unless all songs are in a playlist.
  - **Use Case:** Best if the user has organized their library into a playlist.

- **Sunodl:**
  - **Strength:** Can extract songs from artist pages (likely the full library), handles multiple URL types (songs, playlists, artist pages), command-line flexibility.
  - **Limitation:** Requires Python setup, less intuitive for non-technical users, assumes all songs are visible on the artist page.
  - **Use Case:** Ideal for directly accessing a user's entire library via their artist page URL.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Yes, the provided tools can extract all songs from a Suno.com user's song library:

- **Via Playlists:** The Suno Music Downloader (`Sunodownloader/`) fetches and downloads all songs from a playlist URL, suitable if the user's library is represented as a playlist.
- **Via Artist Pages:** The Sunodl Python scripts (`Sunodl/`) extract and download all songs from a user's artist page, offering a direct method to access the full library.

For a complete solution, **Sunodl** is more directly applicable since artist pages typically list all user-created songs, while the Tauri app requires a playlist intermediary. Both tools successfully download the songs once extracted, with Sunodl providing broader URL compatibility and the Tauri app offering a polished desktop experience.

### Best Tips and Tricks for Using Suno

#### 1. Prompt Structuring

Crafting effective prompts is key to controlling Suno’s output:

- **Punctuation Matters**: Use commas (,) for short pauses, ellipses (…) for longer pauses, and quotation marks ("") to shift voice styles or accents (e.g., "Southern drawl"). Capitalize words (e.g., LOVE) for emphasis.
- **Unique Accents**: Add non-standard characters (e.g., ø for "uh," რ for rolled "r") in lyrics, then remaster with standard text to get creative vocal styles.
- **Detailed Style Prompts**: In the "Style of Music" field (max 200 characters), include genre, instruments, atmosphere, and specifics like BPM or vocal type. Example: "Epic Orchestral, war drums, male choir, heroic, 78 BPM, contralto voice."

#### 2. Song Structure

A clear structure helps Suno deliver cohesive songs:

- **Standard Layout**: Use tags like `[Intro]`, `[Verse]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Outro]` to organize sections. Add `[Instrumental]` or `[Guitar Solo]` for variety.
- **Meta-Tags**: Enhance control with tags like `[Dynamic: ff]` (loud), `[Tempo: 80 BPM]`, or `[Instructions: Build intensity]`. Example: `[Chorus, Full Orchestra, Choir, ff, Build intensity]`.
- **Instrumentals First**: Generate an instrumental base, then extend with lyrics for better vocal integration.

#### 3. Vocal Control

Fine-tune vocals for your vision:

- **Specify Voices**: Use `[Male Vocal]`, `[Female Vocal]`, or `[Duet]` before sections. For duets, assign lines like `[Male] Line 1`, `[Female] Line 2`.
- **Call and Response**: Tag `[Call and Response]` or alternate voices for dynamic interplay. Regenerate if voices misalign.
- **Unique Effects**: Try `[Whisper]`, `[Melismatic]` (runs across scales), or `[Kulning]` (high-pitched calls) for expressive vocals.

#### 4. Avoiding Common Issues

Suno v4 has quirks—here’s how to fix them:

- **Buried Vocals**: Boost 2kHz–5kHz, cut 200Hz–500Hz in instruments post-download.
- **Harsh Highs**: Reduce 8kHz–12kHz to tame cymbals or sibilance ("S" sounds).
- **Muddy Mix**: Cut 200Hz–400Hz for clarity.
- **Abrupt Endings**: Add `[Fade Out]` or manually fade in an editor.

#### 5. Creative Techniques

Push Suno’s boundaries with these hacks:

- **Onomatopoeia**: Use `[Sitar, shimmering note, eeeeeennnnnn]` for complex effects.
- **Genre Blending**: Mix styles like "Hindi Boombap" or "Japanese Reggae" for unique results.
- **External Tools**: Use ChatGPT to craft lyrics or structures, then refine in Suno. Example: Ask for a "tribal epic" structure, then tag it with `[Taiko Drums, Choir]`.

#### 6. Post-Processing

Polish your tracks after generation:

- **Download WAV**: Always opt for WAV over MP3 for higher quality.
- **EQ Fixes**: Cut muddiness (200Hz–400Hz), tame highs (8kHz–12kHz), boost presence (2kHz–5kHz).
- **Stereo Adjustments**: Convert to mono to fix extreme panning, then widen subtly with tools like BandLab or Audacity.

#### 7. Miscellaneous Tips

- **Double Brackets**: Use `[[]]` for tags (e.g., `[[Chop, Echo]]`) to avoid Suno singing them as lyrics.
- **Randomness**: Add QRNG strings (e.g., from qrng.anu.edu.au) to prompts for variety.
- **Monetization Hack**: For free-version songs, extend by a few seconds and regenerate to potentially bypass restrictions (check Suno’s terms).

### Examples from Users

- **Epic Music**: `[Chorus, Thunderous Choir, Taiko Drums, ff]` with lyrics like “Odin guides us!” creates a cinematic climax ([Epoyato](https://suno.com/song/0d77cdd9-d49c-44eb-9ac2-c3c6a910e910)).
- **Duet**: `[Male] I sing this… [Female] I reply…` for alternating voices ([CharmingAd2038](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Ompx6uQfyGKYtIIm5Lgz0)).
- **Instrumental**: Use symbolic patterns (e.g., `|-| … |_|`) instead of lyrics with `[Indie Rock, Fingerpicking]` ([Tr0ubledove](https://suno.com/song/5ce6900e-51a1-4072-b370-b8e9d54fcd41)).

---

### Final Advice

Suno shines when you experiment. Start simple—try `[Intro, Soft Piano]`, `[Chorus, Female Vocal, ff]`—then layer complexity. Regenerate often (5–20 times) to refine results, and don’t shy away from post-editing for polish. Whether you’re crafting a tribal anthem or a chill instrumental, these tips will elevate your Suno creations!
