# Suno.com Bulk Download Automation Guide

**Title:** Automating Bulk Download of Songs from Suno.com

**Prompt:**

Research and provide an **automated or semi-automated method** for **downloading all songs** from a Suno.com account in **MP3 format**, including **cover images, lyrics, and metadata**. The user has **experience with automation and scripting**, has access to browser developer tools, and has already **attempted JavaScript-based solutions** but still needs to **manually scrape URLs**.

### Key Areas to Explore

1. **Extracting Song URLs:**
   - Methods to **automate** URL scraping for **all** songs in a Suno library.
   - Browser DevTools techniques, JavaScript console scripts, or API calls to obtain direct **MP3 download links** for each song.
   - Handling pagination or infinite scroll issues.

2. **Bulk Downloading the Songs:**
   - Using command-line tools (`wget`, `curl`) or Python scripts (`requests`, `aiohttp`).
   - Ensuring correct file naming (title instead of UUIDs).
   - Checking for third-party scripts or open-source tools that automate Suno downloads.

3. **Extracting Cover Images:**
   - Retrieving album art via Suno’s backend or metadata extraction.
   - Batch downloading cover images for each song using URLs.

4. **Fetching Lyrics & Metadata:**
   - Investigate **where Suno stores lyrics** (e.g., in song metadata, API responses, or within the web UI).
   - Extracting lyrics using JavaScript, API calls, or direct scraping.
   - Obtaining other metadata such as song title, creation date, tags, etc.

5. **Using Unofficial APIs or Reverse Engineering Suno’s Backend:**
   - Any **existing** third-party libraries or **unofficial API wrappers** in Python, Node.js, etc.
   - Methods to authenticate and retrieve song data programmatically.
   - Ethical considerations when using unofficial APIs.

6. **Legal & Ethical Considerations:**
   - Suno’s terms of service regarding content downloads.
   - Allowed use cases (e.g., personal backups vs. redistribution).
   - Rate-limiting or polite scraping practices to avoid excessive server requests.

### Expected Output

- A **step-by-step guide** for automating the bulk download process.
- Working **JavaScript & Python code snippets** to achieve automation.
- Details on **any relevant browser extensions, tools, or open-source projects** that simplify the process.
- **Legal disclaimers** on the appropriate use of the downloaded content.

If third-party tools exist that automate this **without requiring complex scripting**, include links and instructions for using them.
