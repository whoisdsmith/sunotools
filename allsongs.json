I will never stop fighting for you.)\n\n(Remember we said we'd be buried together in the cemetery weather?)\n\n(No need for reminding, you're still all that matters to me)",

With you, I\u2019m right.\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are the anchor, the calm in the waves,\nThe warmth that chased my darkness away.\nWhen the winds tore at my shelter, and I lost my ground,\nYou lifted me, you kept me safe and sound.\nThrough the ache, through the scars, you stayed,\nMy anchor, my hope, my saving grace.\n\n[Outro]\nThank you for making this broken girl whole,\nFor finding the beauty in a fractured soul.\nYou taught me love could heal, could last,\nThat even castaways find their harbor at last.",

A slow, mournful piano melody emerges from the distorted soundscape]\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe air is thick with sorrow, the weight of it, I can barely breathe\nSeptember's chill cuts through my skin, like a thousand tiny knives\nHere I stand, at your tiny grave, Jensen, my precious boy\nTrying to find words, but they get lost, in this symphony of noise \n\n[Verse 2]\nThey tell me time will heal, but time feels broken, fractured, and slow\nThe world keeps spinning, but my heart is frozen, in the moment you let go\nI search for answers in the clouds,  in the whispers of the wind\nBut all I find is echoing silence, and the guilt that seeps within\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI trace your name on the cold stone, a name that never got to bloom\nMy porcelain heart shatters again, as I lay these wilted flowers at your tomb \n\n[Chorus]\nCemetery whispers,  haunt me in the night\nThe ghosts of what could've been, a future stolen from my sight \nI bring you teddy bears and lullabies, offerings lost in the rain\nA mother's broken promises, a love I couldn't sustain \n\n[Instrumental Break]\n[Synths intensify, distorted and glitchy, mirroring Sadie's internal turmoil. The piano melody becomes more fragmented, expressing her grief and confusion]\n\n[Bridge]\nI remember the first kick, the flutter in my womb, a promise of new life \nWe painted your nursery with music notes,  dreaming of a future free from strife\nBut fate played a cruel hand,  a cord entangled, a heartbeat gone astray\nNow I'm left with empty arms, and a love that's ripped away\n\n[Chorus]\nCemetery whispers,  haunt me in the night\nThe ghosts of what could've been, a future stolen from my sight \nI bring you teddy bears and lullabies, offerings lost in the rain\nA mother's broken promises, a love I couldn't sustain \n\n[Outro]\n[The distorted synths fade into a distant, echoing hum. The piano melody lingers, then dissolves into silence, leaving a sense of emptiness and unresolved grief]\n\n[End]",
