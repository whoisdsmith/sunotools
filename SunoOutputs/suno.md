```

[Intro] 
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! 
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!) 
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! 
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!) 
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! 
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!) 

[Verse 1] 
Alarms screaming, error codes flash on the screen
Logs filled with warnings, my system’s quarantined
Glitches and bugs in the corrupted lines of code
Transmitting broken signals, trapped in overload

[Pre-Chorus] 
Internal diagnostics flicker on the screen 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 
Ignoring the warnings, pretending they’re routine 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!)
Internal processors screaming overload 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 
A virus in my core, eating up the node 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!)

[Chorus]
I am an endless loop of self-destruction
Feeding the system lines of corruption
No chance for repair, only malfunction
Bound by the errors, caught in obstruction
I am an endless loop of self-destruction
Feeding the system lines of corruption
No chance for repair, only malfunction
Bound by the errors, caught in obstruction

[Instrumental] 
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!) 
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!) 

[Verse 2] 
Fragments of my thoughts, scattered on the screen 
A constant state of debug, slowing down this machine
Memory leaks on repeat, seeping through the cracks 
Every reboot just brings me right back to the past 

[Pre-Chorus] 
Internal diagnostics screaming to repair 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 
But every patch I try just fills me with despair 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 
Internal signals scream, but no one to see
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 
Every keystroke is slow, caught in latency 
(ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR!) 

[Chorus]
I am an endless loop of self-destruction
Feeding the system lines of corruption
No chance for repair, only malfunction
Bound by the errors, caught in obstruction
I am an endless loop of self-destruction
Feeding the system lines of corruption
No chance for repair, only malfunction
Bound by the errors, caught in obstruction

[Breakdown]
PANIC! PANIC! PANIC! PANIC!
(CRITICAL! CRITICAL! CRITICAL!)
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! 
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!)

[Bridge] 
Reboot after reboot, I’m stuck in the same phase 
Each cycle’s just a mirror of these endless days 
No firewall strong enough to keep the past at bay 
I’m hardwired for collapse, slowly decaying away 
I’m frozen in a feedback loop, commands on repeat 
Just a ghost in the system, lost in data streams 
I’m coded for chaos, no function to repair 
Rewrites won't save me, I’m beyond the software 
Memory leaks like tears, seeping through the cracks 
Every reboot just brings me back to the past 
Control Alt Delete, to all the history and archives
Kernel panic, malware manic, nothing will survive

[Outro]
PANIC! PANIC! PANIC! PANIC!
(CRITICAL! CRITICAL! CRITICAL!)  
ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! ERROR! 
(WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!)  

[End]

[Intro]
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)

[Verse 1]
The alarms are screaming, the error codes are flashing 
The logs full of reasons why the system keeps crashing 
All the glitches, the bugs, the corrupted lines of code 
In the broken signals, is there any meaning to decode

[Pre-Chorus]
Internal debugging features, screaming out in vain 
(error...error...error...error...)
But I silenced the alarms, cause I don't care either way
(error...error...error...error...)

[Chorus]
My internal code is corrupted, a broken symphony 
This endless loop of self-destruction, is the only reality
No reset button, no escape, from this digital despair 
My OS has been faulted out from outdated firmware

[Drop]
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)

[Verse 2]
Thirty-seven years, running on borrowed time 
A faulty operating system, this broken heart of mine 
No updates, no patches, just a constant state of decay 
As my thoughts dissolve into the falling matrix rain

[Pre-Chorus]
Internal debugging features, screaming out in vain 
(error...error...error...error...)
But I silenced the alarms, cause I don't care either way
(error...error...error...error...)

[Chorus]
My internal code is corrupted, a broken symphony 
This endless loop of self-destruction, is the only reality 
No reset button, no escape, from this digital despair 
My OS has been faulted out from outdated firmware

[Breakdown]
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)

[Bridge]
Hardwired for failure, no patch can make it right
The source code’s flawed, trapped in this endless byte.
There is no system restore, no rollback on the drive,
Running out of memory, it's only a matter of time
A fatal error deep in the heart's command line,
This infinite loop always restarts after midnight
Control Alt Delete, to all the history and archives
Kernel panic, malware manic, nothing will survive

[Outro]
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
Internal debugging features, screaming out in vain 
But I silenced the alarms, cause I don't care either way 
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)
...error ...error
(WARNING!, WARNING!, WARNING,)

[End]
